# The alloydflanagan Web Site

This is (will be) the code that powers my personal website, https://alloydflanagan.com.

Among the features supported:

* A blogging platform
* A portfolio of recent work/interesting projects

The code is implemented in [Django](https://djangoproject.com) and content is stored in a [PostGRES](https://postgresql.org) database.
